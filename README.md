# CEP-2023-Performance-Task-1: Typeracer

  - Please note that the organisation of the webpage would be messy since the positions are only correct for my computer screen. Sorry ðŸ˜¢

- What it does ðŸ“Š
  - It acts like any other typeracer, where you would type the given text and you would receive your speed and accuracy at the end of typing test. In the case of my typeracer, it is Harry Potter themed! Texts that are give are from the book Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. 
  
  How it is built âš¡
  - I built it with a plain HTML frontend with Javascript and CSS. 
  
  Important Note ðŸ¤·
  - This typeracer game would still manage to work when you randomly type in things into the input area, or decide to copy and paste the text or any other forms of cheating. Essentially, one can fake his own results and attain an extremely high wpm (but most likely a low accuracy). The way I see this type of behaviour is that these users are basically wasting their time. I coded this typeracer (not only for my CEP project) so people who actually wish to find their wpm and have fun typing can do just that. To have a genuine result after playing typeracer would boil down to the users actually playing "properly". Whether or not the user decides to follow these simple rules is their decision, but I do hope that this typeracer can be appreciated and properly played with!
    
   HAPPY TYPING! ðŸ’š
