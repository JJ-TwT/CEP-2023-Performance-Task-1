- "Bar" 
  - In this section, I wanted to create a bar which would fill up based on the completion of the text. I was planning to implement it such that it would follow the percentage of the number of characters over the total number of characters. I would also have made the broom slowly follow the bar increase and reach the golden snitch (reference to Harry Potter Quidditch). Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to complete this aspect of the project as I had to focus on the indispensable elements of a typeracer first, before working on the aesthetics.

  - At the bottom of the webpage, I included 2 hyperlinks: One that would link to my Github page where it showcases the code and my write-ups, in the case that the users would like to check out the backend of the project. The second link sends the users to a Google Form where they could provide their comments of the game. Since Github only has pull requests as a form of a "comment section", this method allows a better and easier way to give comments about the game to me.
