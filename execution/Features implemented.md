  o At the bottom of the webpage, I included 2 hyperlinks: One that would link to my Github page where it showcases the code and my write-ups, in the case that the users would like to check out the backend of the project. The second link sends the users to a Google Form where they could provide their comments of the game. Since Github only has pull requests as a form of a "comment section", this method allows a better and easier way to give comments about the game to me.
