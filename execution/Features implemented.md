FEATURES ADDED
---------------
- Rules

- Timer

- Text

- Input area

- "Bar" 
  - In this section, I wanted to create a bar which would fill up based on the completion of the text. I was planning to implement it such that it would follow the percentage of the number of characters over the total number of characters. I would also have made the broom slowly follow the bar increase and reach the golden snitch (reference to Harry Potter Quidditch). Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to complete this aspect of the project as I had to focus on the indispensable elements of a typeracer first, before working on the aesthetics. 

- Results section
  - 
  - Time: The time is taken from the timer at the top right of the screen. After the user has keyed in the last character of the text, the time would also be reflected in the "time" section of the results for the user to see.
  - Wpm: 
  - Accuracy:
  - Words: The number of words is based on input of the users. It counts the number of spaces inside the input, and when the user is typing, the number of words is always reflected in the "word" section in the results. When the user has reached the number of characters inside the entire text, the number of words that has been inputed would be recorded and also be used to calculate the wpm (so that the wpm would not change all the time, although the word count would still continue to increase should the user continue typing).
  
- Thanks
  - At the bottom of the webpage, I included 2 hyperlinks: One that would link to my Github page where it showcases the code and my write-ups, in the case that the users would like to check out the backend of the project. The second link sends the users to a Google Form where they could provide their comments of the game. Since Github only has pull requests as a form of a "comment section", this method allows a better and easier way to give comments about the game to me.
