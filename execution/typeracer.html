          Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made
          drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did
          have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had
          nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as
          she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on
          the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their
          opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
